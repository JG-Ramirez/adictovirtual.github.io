##Work for the web


I have been working in this field since  2010 from that time i didn't know that this trip would become a interesting and exciting path.

At the beginning my first approach was as a full stack ðŸ˜… developer using YII framework as my coach,JQuery as my partner and MySQL was my opponent,the databases was an opponent hard to defeat  for that reason i decided to take a decision my focus would be the front side of the web from that day i have been trying to be learning all the best practices and expanding my craft.


JQuery my first friend i thought that everything could be fixed with $ but the things was not so easy,new upcoming challenges made me move to other approaches.

CSS raw was my strong skill but after some time i found myself repeating rules and selectors, For that reason i decided to look for a methodology that guided  me through the  DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) way,Several methodologies come to me SMACCS ,OOCSS and  BEM, SMACCS is a brilliant methodology created by Jonathan Snook , for some months this was my only way to write css but BEM came to me with its expressive classes and blocks and i felt in love literally.
