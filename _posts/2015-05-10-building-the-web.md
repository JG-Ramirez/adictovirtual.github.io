##Work for the web


I have been working in this field since  2010 from that time i didn't know that this trip would become a interesting and exciting path.

At the beginning my first approach was as a full stack ðŸ˜… developer using YII framework as my coach,JQuery as my partner and MySQL was my opponent,the databases was an opponent hard to defeat  for that reason i decided to take a decision my focus would be the front side of the web from that day i have been trying to be learning all the best practices and expanding my craft.
