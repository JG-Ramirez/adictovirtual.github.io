        Juan and I had an opportunity to work together at American Media at a very interesting time. The company was hiring more developers in South America as well as Ukraine and there was an urgent need for someone to simply come in and start knocking out a boat load of issues without too much hand holding. 
        I'm happy to say that Juan was able to accomplish this very quickly and really showcased a range of other talents in design as well as back-end development. I was very happy to have Juan join the team and despite the various cultures and time zones I was working with, Juan was very accommodating and flexible to get the job done. 
        I look forward to perhaps working with Juan again in the future and I know that he will be successful in any challenge he takes on next.

        Juan always brought his web development skills to the table and was an excellent leader and ‚Äòdoer‚Äô in any team situation. His many years as a web development experience were evident in the way he approached tasks and completed each project. He is great in dealing with difficult projects and a fantastic problem solver. I recommend him to anyone looking for a strong web developer.

      Juan was able to receive Yieldbot's integration requirements with the distributed AMI sites very quickly, and was able to translate the solution very efficiently. He was able to unify the codebase around the ad tagging for all the AMI sites and created a uniform/standard framework where we were quickly able to replicate the integration to all AMI sites successfully. We were able to hit our deployment goals ahead of schedule due to this, and in turn, the revenue goals to AMI. It was a pleasure to work with Juan, and would not hesitate to work with Juan again in the future.
